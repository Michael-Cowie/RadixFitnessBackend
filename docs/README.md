    <h1> Django REST Framework (DRF) </h1>
</div>

This project uses Django as the backend and utilizes [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/) to build a RESTful API. We do not serve HTML pages from Django. Instead, Django acts purely as an API layer.

## Administration

To run as administrator, traverse to `http://localhost:8000/admin/`. A superuser has been created with username and 
password as `admin`. This will allow to edit the database.


## API Documentation

API documentation is done by using `drf-yasg` and is accessible using `http://.../swagger/`.
